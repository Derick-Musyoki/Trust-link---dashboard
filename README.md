# 🔗 TrustLink – Digital Business Trust Dashboard

TrustLink is a simple web-based prototype designed to help informal and small businesses build digital trust through customer ratings, delivery confirmation, and complaint tracking.

The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on learning core web development concepts such as authentication, local storage, and basic business logic — without heavy frameworks or AI.
